-- Stacks and Queues --

Dynamic arrays and Linked lists are commonly used to implement stacks and queues

Queue Vs Stack

Queue = First In First Out (FIFO)
    -- line at store

Stack = Last In First Out (LIFO)
    -- stack of plates

Queues are all about the beginning and the end - not the middle
    -- Linked Lists are really fast at the front and the end, but slow in the middle
    -- Dynamic Arrays are fast at the end and the middle
    -- Therefore, linked lists are used to implement Queues rather than dynamic arrays

Stacks are all about the beginning or the end -- not the middle or both ends
    -- Therefore, either linked lists or dynamic arrays can be used to implement Stacks
    -- Stacks can use either the beginning or the end, but not both
